                    Binturongs are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List which is the ranking just before endangered.
                    The population has declined at least 30% since the mid-1980s.<br><br>
                    Habitat loss and degradation of forests through logging are a major threat to the binturong.
                    In the Philippines, it is captured for the wildlife trade, and in the south of its range it is also taken for human consumption.
                    In parts of Laos, it is considered a delicacy and also traded as a food item to Vietnam.<br><br>
                    World Binturong Day is a yearly event held in several zoos and is dedicated to binturong awareness and conservation.
                    It takes place every second Saturday of May.
